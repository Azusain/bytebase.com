Changelist allows you to sequentially list all changes and apply them to the databases. You access Changelist from the Change Center:

![Change Center](/content/docs/changelist/change-center.webp)

A particular change can come from the following sources:

- [Change History](/docs/change-database/change-workflow/#migration-history). The change already executed on the database.

- [Branch](/docs/branching). The differences between the latest branch state and its baseline schema.

- Raw SQL. Arbitrary SQL statements.
